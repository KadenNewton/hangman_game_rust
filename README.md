# A hangman game written in rust

This was just a little intro to rust as I haven't written anything in it yet and I felt that I should get something small out of the way to start.
A lot of the code was taken from this repository https://github.com/katecpp/Hangman. This project was made solely for learning, I took what katecpp implemented in their program and implemented into my own, that is all.
